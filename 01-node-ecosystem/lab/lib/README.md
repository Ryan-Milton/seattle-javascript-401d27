###Summary

##greet.js
- The greet function checks to see that the input is a string.
- If the input is not a string then return null.
- If the input is a string then concatenate that onto the greet message.
- I am exporting the greet function from this file.

##arithmetic.js
- There are 2 functions in this file.
- The first function is called add and checks to see that the 2 arguments passed in are numbers.
- If the arguments are both numbers then return the sum of those two numbers.
- The second function is called sub and checks to see that the 2 arguments passed in are numbers.
- If the arguments are both numbers then return the difference of those two numbers.
- Both functions are exported as a property of an object.
