## Code
Due to the fact that I was unable to completely finish the code on my own I went to the video of the first hour of class and I made the corrections to my code based on what was shown in code review and I am now able to succesfully /signup and /signin and store HASHED passwords in the databse. Thank you for making the code review available so I could better myself.
